        <h3>Impact of Pricing Strategy on Consumer Electronics</h3>
        <p>This project explores the impact of pricing strategy and brand perception on consumer behaviour towards consumer electronics. Using responses from 200 participants across Chennai and Vellore, the study highlights how Gen Z and millennials dominate the market, with smartphones being the most purchased product. Findings show that pricing directly influences switching behaviour, while strong brand reputation (Apple, Samsung) drives loyalty despite price hikes. Online platforms like Amazon and Flipkart are preferred over offline stores, proving a generational shift in buying patterns. Statistical tests (Chi-square, ANOVA, Correlation, Regression) confirm significant associations between pricing, brand perception, and consumer behaviour. Overall, todayâ€™s consumers are value-conscious, brand-driven, and heavily influenced by digital platforms and peer reviews.</p>

        <h3>Financial Inclusion: Bringing Banks into Rural Masses</h3>
        <p>This study examines the role of financial inclusion in promoting economic growth and reducing inequality in India. It highlights how access to banking, digital payments, and credit has improved but still faces challenges in rural penetration, financial literacy, and gender disparity. Using survey responses and secondary data, the research applies statistical tools to show a positive link between financial inclusion and sustainable development. Findings suggest that while government initiatives (Jan Dhan Yojana, UPI) boosted accessibility, long-term impact depends on bridging awareness gaps and ensuring inclusive participation across all sections of society.Additional insights show that financial inclusion also empowers women entrepreneurs by giving them access to credit and resources. It plays a key role in reducing dependence on informal lending, which often exploits rural borrowers.</p>

        <h3>Data-Driven Insights into Traditional financing vs Alternative financing for Startup Ecosystem</h3>
        <p>This project analyzes how traditional and alternative financing methods impact the Indian startup ecosystem. It compares factors like awareness, flexibility, risk, stability, and challenges using survey-based data. The study shows that while traditional financing offers security, alternative options such as angel investors and venture capital provide greater flexibility and growth opportunities. Statistical tests (Chi-square, ANOVA) highlight significant differences in perception, with startups increasingly leaning toward alternative financing for innovation and scalability. The findings stress the need for a balanced approach, combining reliability of traditional funding with the dynamism of alternative sources.</p>
